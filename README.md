# Timeseries-GANs
We implement the [FinGAN](https://github.com/stakahashy/fingan) and [TimeGAN](https://github.com/jsyoon0823/TimeGAN) models for generating financial time series in PyTorch. A joint work between https://github.com/ReissMoore (worked primarily on FinGAN) and https://github.com/sanj909 (worked primarily on TimeGAN).
